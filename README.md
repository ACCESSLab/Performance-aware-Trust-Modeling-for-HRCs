# Performance-aware-Trust-Modeling-for-HRCs

This project is developed at North Carolina A&T State University, ACCESS LAB. The aim of this project is to develop a novel time-driven mathematical model for trust considering human-multi-robot performance for a Human-robot Collaboration (HRC) framework.
The library for [fixed performance (without learning)]() or [improving performance (with learning)]() helps to quantify 
* human performance considering the effects of physical and cognitive constraints and factors such as muscle fatigue and recovery, muscle isometric force, human (cognitive and physical) workload and workloads due to the robots' mistakes, and task complexity. 
* multi-robot performance based upon the rate of task assignment and completion as well as the mistake probabilities of the individual robots.
